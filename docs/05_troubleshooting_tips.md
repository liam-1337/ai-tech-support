# 5. Troubleshooting & Getting Help

This section provides tips for what to do if the AI Tech Support Agent isn't providing the answers you expect, or if you encounter issues while using it.

## When AI Answers Seem Off or Unexpected

If an answer from the AI doesn't seem quite right, or if it's not what you were looking for, here are a few things you can try:

1.  **Rephrase Your Question:**
    *   **Try different keywords:** If your initial query didn't yield good results, think of synonyms or alternative ways to describe the issue. For example, instead of "VPN won't connect," try "VPN connection error [specific error number if you have one]."
    *   **Be more specific:** If your question was broad ("My computer is slow"), try adding more details ("My Dell laptop is slow when opening Outlook").
    *   **Be less specific:** If you were very specific and got no results (or an "I don't know" response), try broadening your query slightly, as the exact phrasing might not match the knowledge base.
    *   **Break down complex questions:** Ask a series of simpler, related questions instead of one very complex one.

2.  **Review the Source Documents:**
    *   As detailed in "[Understanding AI Responses](./03_understanding_ai_responses.md)", the AI often provides "Sources" with its answers. These are snippets from the knowledge base it used.
    *   **Expand and read these sources.** The AI's summary might be missing a nuance that the original text provides, or the source itself might not be a perfect match for your specific scenario.
    *   This can help you understand *why* the AI gave a particular answer.

3.  **Consider Knowledge Gaps:**
    *   As mentioned in the "[Knowledge Sources](./04_knowledge_sources.md)" section, the AI only knows what's in its loaded knowledge base. If you're asking about a very new system, a highly specialized internal application not yet documented for the AI, or a topic outside its intended scope, it may correctly state that it doesn't have the information.

## Common Usage Issues & Tips

*   **AI Doesn't Seem to Understand My Question:**
    *   Refer back to the "[Tips for Phrasing Effective Questions](./02_using_the_chat_interface.md#tips-for-phrasing-effective-questions)". Clear, specific questions with relevant context usually get the best results.

*   **AI is Slow to Respond:**
    *   Generating answers, especially if they involve searching a large knowledge base and using a complex language model, can take a few moments.
    *   Please be patient. If it seems excessively slow (e.g., more than 30 seconds), you could try sending a simpler version of your query or reloading the interface and trying again after a short break. If slowness is persistent, please report it.

*   **Chat Interface Not Loading or Displaying Correctly:**
    *   **Refresh the page:** This is often the quickest fix for minor display glitches (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R).
    *   **Check your internet/company network connection.**
    *   **Try clearing your browser's cache and cookies** (for this specific site, if your browser allows), then reload the page. Instructions for this vary by browser.
    *   **Try a different web browser:** This can help determine if the issue is specific to one browser. If it works in another browser, please report this detail.

## Providing Feedback & Reporting Issues

Your feedback is crucial for identifying knowledge gaps, improving the AI's accuracy, and fixing any technical problems.

*   **For issues with the AI's answers (e.g., incorrect, irrelevant, missing information where you expect it to exist):**
    *   Note down:
        *   The exact question(s) you asked.
        *   The AI's full answer.
        *   The source documents provided (if any).
        *   Why you believe the answer is problematic or what information was missing.
*   **For issues with the AI agent's functionality (e.g., bugs in the chat interface, errors appearing, very slow performance):**
    *   Note down:
        *   What you were doing when the issue occurred.
        *   Any error messages you saw (screenshots can be very helpful).
        *   The date and time of the issue.

**How to Report:**
Please send your feedback or report any issues to the **[Specify Central IT Helpdesk Contact Method - e.g., "IT Helpdesk via a new ticket under category 'AI Support Agent Feedback'", or "dedicated email support-ai-feedback@example.com", or "Microsoft Teams channel #ai-support-feedback"]**. Providing specific examples, including your original question and the AI's response, will help us address the problem more effectively.

## Conclusion

We hope the AI Tech Support Agent becomes a valuable and efficient tool in your daily IT support tasks. Like any advanced technology, it has its strengths and areas for ongoing improvement.
