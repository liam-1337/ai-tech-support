# AI Tech Support Agent - User Guide

Welcome to the User Guide for the AI Tech Support Agent!

This guide is designed to help IT staff and colleagues effectively use our advanced AI agent to find information and solutions for common IT support issues. The agent leverages a **continuously updated knowledge base** built from internal documents and analyzed IT support tickets. It offers **context-aware assistance** for complex issues through **multi-turn conversations** thanks to session persistence, provides **automated guidance** for common repetitive tasks, can **escalate issues to human support** when necessary, and its interactions are logged to help it learn and improve over time.

## Key Features of the Enhanced Agent

Our AI Tech Support Agent now includes several advanced features to better assist you:

*   **Continuously Updated Knowledge**: The AI draws information from a knowledge base that is regularly updated with the latest documents and insights, ensuring greater accuracy and relevance.
*   **Context-Aware Conversations**: Thanks to session persistence, the AI can understand the context of your ongoing conversation, allowing for more effective multi-turn interactions when troubleshooting complex problems.
*   **Automated Guidance**: For common issues like password resets or connectivity problems, the AI can provide pre-defined, structured troubleshooting steps to guide you quickly.
*   **Intelligent Escalation**: If the AI determines it cannot resolve your issue, or if you explicitly request it, the problem can be escalated to human support staff, and a ticket can be automatically generated.
*   **Learning & Improvement**: Key interaction details are logged (anonymously where appropriate), which helps us analyze and improve the AI's performance and knowledge over time.
