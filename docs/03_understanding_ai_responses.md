# 3. Understanding AI Responses

The AI Tech Support Agent is designed to provide you with helpful answers based on its knowledge base. This section explains how to understand the information it presents.

## Structure of an AI Answer

When the AI responds to your query, you'll typically see a few key pieces of information within its message bubble:

1.  **The Main Answer:**
    *   This is the direct text response generated by the AI, attempting to address your question. It's synthesized from the information the AI found relevant in its knowledge base.

2.  **Source Documents / Chunks (If applicable):**
    *   **What are they?** Below the main answer, if the AI used specific documents from its knowledge base to formulate the answer, you will usually see a "Sources" section. These are the actual snippets of text (chunks) from the underlying IT documents or processed support tickets that the AI identified as most relevant to your query.
    *   **Why are they important?** Sources provide transparency and allow you to:
        *   See the origin of the AI's information.
        *   Verify the answer against the original text.
        *   Explore the source text for more details or context if needed.
    *   **How are they displayed?** Sources are typically shown as expandable sections (e.g., a "X Source(s)" link that you can click). Clicking on a source will reveal the text of that chunk and often a relevance score.

3.  **Relevance Scores (for Sources):**
    *   Each source chunk is usually accompanied by a "score" (e.g., "Score: 0.852").
    *   **What it means:** This score is a numerical representation of how relevant the AI's search mechanism (semantic search) deemed that particular chunk to be in relation to your question. A higher score generally means higher relevance *according to the search algorithm*.
    *   **Important Note:** While helpful, this score is machine-generated. It's a good indicator, but always use your judgment to assess if the source is truly useful for your specific situation. The most relevant chunk to the AI might not always be the most helpful part for your specific nuance of the problem.

## When the AI Says It Doesn't Know

As defined by its programming (using the `LLM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`), if the AI cannot find relevant information in its knowledge base to answer your question, it should explicitly state this. You might see responses like:

*   "The provided information does not directly answer this question."
*   Or, if it attempts a general answer due to no context, it might be less specific than you need.

**Why this happens:** This means the AI searched its knowledge base (company documents, processed tickets) but could not find specific information for your query.

**This is a feature, not a bug!** It's important that the AI avoids making up answers (often called "hallucination") when it doesn't have the relevant data.

## Evaluating AI Answers: Be a Critical User

The AI Tech Support Agent is a powerful tool, but it's essential to use it wisely:

*   **The AI is an Assistant:** Think of it as a very knowledgeable assistant that can quickly search vast amounts of information. However, it's not infallible and its knowledge is confined to what it has been fed.
*   **Use Your Judgment:** Always apply your own technical knowledge and judgment to the answers provided. If something seems off, or if a solution involves critical system changes, be cautious.
*   **Verify if Necessary:** For critical tasks or information, refer to the source documents provided by the AI. If still unsure, consult official standalone documentation or experienced colleagues.
*   **Potential for Errors:** An AI's answer can only be as good as the information in its knowledge base. If a source document is outdated or contains an error, the AI might inadvertently repeat that.

By understanding how the AI formulates its answers and by critically evaluating the information, you can use the agent effectively as a valuable support tool.

## Next Steps

Knowing where the AI's information comes from can also help you understand its capabilities and limitations.
