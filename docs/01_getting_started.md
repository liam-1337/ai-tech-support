# 1. Getting Started

Welcome! This section will guide you through accessing the AI Tech Support Agent and give you a brief overview of what you'll see when you first open it.

## Accessing the AI Agent

To start using the AI Tech Support Agent, you'll need to open it in your web browser.

*   **URL:**
    *   If you are running the agent locally for testing or development, it will typically be available at: `http://localhost:3000`
    *   For the production version used by the team, please use the URL provided by your IT department or supervisor.
*   **Access Requirements:** Currently, no special login is required to access and use the AI agent. However, ensure you are connected to the company network if accessing an internally hosted version.

## First Look: The Main Interface

When you open the AI Agent, you'll see a clean and straightforward chat interface. Here are the main parts:

*   **Header:** At the top, you'll see the title "AI Tech Support Agent."
*   **Chat Display Area:** This is the largest part of the screen. It's where your conversation with the AI (your questions and the AI's answers) will appear. When you first open it, it might show a "Conversation starts here." message or be ready for your first query.
*   **Message Input Box:** Located at the bottom of the chat window, this is where you'll type your questions or describe the IT issue you're facing. It will have placeholder text like "Type your question or issue here...".
*   **Send Button:** Next to the input box, this button (often showing an icon like a paper plane) allows you to send your typed message to the AI.
